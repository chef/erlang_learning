# Basic functional programming in Erlang

Today we'll talk about functional programming, including
* What is it?
* Pure functions and immutability
* Recursion vs loops
* Tail recursion
  * What is it
  * Rewriting to be tail recursive (list append)
* Common idioms: Map, Filter and Fold
* List comprehensions
* A little bit about functional data structures

---

# Erlang is a functional language

What does that mean?

  * Functions are first class entities, and can be passed and assigned
    like any other type.
  * Functions are pure (*)
     *  Don't have or depend on side effects
  
(*) Technically that isn't always true, due to external state. In Erlang
    there's message passing and other I/O

---

# Erlang is a functional language

Implications:

  * Functions can be passed to other functions and returned from them. 
  * No mutable state
    (That's why variables can't be reassigned).
  * Recursion instead of imperative style 'for' or 'while' loops.
  * Lack of mutable state make it easy to reason about the program.
    * Modern compilers actually rewrite imperative programs
    into a functional formt
  * Processes in Erlang share no state with other processes.

???

* That lack of shared state is what makes Erlang so useful for parallel and distributed systems.

---

# Functions as first class entities.

* We can declare functions

```erlang
example_1(X) ->
  Function = fun(A, B) ->
               A * B
             end.
  Function(X, 1).
```
* While you can get very complex (recursion, guards, etc)
* Function expressions can be a bit opaque, and it might be easier to split it out:
```erlang
example_2(X)
   Function = fun times/2,
   Function(X,1).

times(A, B) ->
   A * B.
```

---

# Functions are first class entities

Functions can be passed to other functions and returned from them.

```erlang
make_increment_by(N) ->
  fun(A) ->
    A + N
  end
```
* This returns a new function that increments by N
* N is captured by the function definition in the body.

???

* Variable capture is vital; we use it everywhere.

---

# Functions can manipulate functions
Functions that can accept and return functions as arguments are *Higher order functions*

```erlang
add(A, B) ->
  A + B.

partial_application(A, F2) ->
  fun(X) ->
    F2(A, X)
  end

make_increment_by(N) ->
  partial_application(1, fun add/2).
```

There's a lot going on here!

???

* partial_application takes a value and any two argument function and makes a new one argument function
* Note that we can refer to a function several ways; we can capture it in a variable and apply it (F2)
* Or a named function can be referred to as fun name/arity

---

# Pure functions and immutability

What if variables weren't immutable and we could change them after the fact?

* Variables captured in a function def could change later
* That would be very hard to reason about.
* A function value wouldn't depend strictly on its arguments anymore
* Our heads would explode.

By accepting immutability, we make other powerful features possible to implement and use.

* Higher order functions
* Parallel execution

But there's a cost.

---

# Recursion and loops: imperative style

Imperative languages have looping constructs

```ruby
while i != 0
  do_something()
  i -= 1 	   
end
```

* But you can't write that in Erlang; 'i' cannot change.

---

# Recursion and loops: functional style

```erlang
loop(0) ->
  ok;
loop(i) ->
  do_something(),
  loop(i-1).
```
???

* We update i by calling the function recursively
* Note we're using pattern match for termination; the loop(0) handles the exit
* Unless do_something() has a side effect, this does nothing, and could be optimized away

---

# But what about the stack?

* On a function call,
  * We push the arguments and return location to the stack
  * And transfer control to the start of the function

* On function return
  * We remove the arguments and replace it with the return value
  * We transfer back to the saved return location.

What happens if we call loop(100000000000)

---

# Stack diagram

.center[![Stack Diagram](Stack_Diagram_1.png)]

???

* Each step in the recursion adds a new stack frame
* If the value is large enough we can use all of our space.

---

# Tail Recursion

But there's an optimization we can perform

* Why do we need to save our state?
  * Because there might be work left to do in the caller!
  
* But what if that's not the case?

  * If the return value from the function is *exactly* the return value from the called function

  * Then we can simply overwrite our caller frame with the callee

---

# Stack with tail recursion

.center[![Stack Diagram](Stack_Diagram_2.png)]

---

# Our example from before is tail recursive

```erlang
loop(0) ->
  ok;
loop(i) ->
  do_something(),
  loop(i-1).
```

---

# Not tail recursive

```erlang
factorial(1) ->
  1;
factorial(N) ->
  N * factorial(N-1).
```

* Why? Because there's work left to be done; we need to multiply the return value

---

# Rewrite to be tail recursive

```erlang
factorial(N) ->
  factorial_step(N, 1).

factorial_step(1, Acc) ->
  Acc;
factorial_step(N, Acc) ->
  factorial_step(N-1, N*Acc).
```

* This pattern with an accumulator is very common
* There are a lot of sophisticated ways to make almost anything tail recursive, such
  as Continuation Passing Style
  
???

* We'll cover CPS and other fancy functional tricks in another session.

---

# Tail recursion; don't expect this in other languages

* Erlang guarantees that the tail recursion optimization is performed.
  *  Nothing would work right without it.

* Ruby generally doesn't.
  * It's not required, and tricky to implement well.
  * Some implementations apparently do try

* Rust doesn't but reserves the right to in the future
  * Adding tail recursion would penalize every function call
  * 'become' keyword exists to allow future work, but not implemented.


---

# Patterns for recursive programming

* First establish the base case (usually the exit case)
  * This case doesn't recurse
  * For factorial it was factorial of 1
  * Often it's the empty list.

* Then establish what each step of the recursion looks like
  * Can we describe this as a incremental step built on a smaller version of the problem
  * For factorial; if we know factorial(N-1) we know how to compute factorial(N)
  * Always check if the problem size decreases; does the data set shrink, etc.

---

# Patterns: Map

We're going to use a list

```erlang
times_two([], Acc) ->
  lists:reverse(Acc);
times_two([Head|Tail], Acc) ->
  times_two(Tail, [Head * 2 | Acc]).

times_two([1, 2, 3], []).
[6, 4, 2]
```

???
* We use match syntax to decompose the list.
* Note that this reverses the list, so we call reverse at the end.

---

# Patterns: Filter

```erlang
# Base case
odd([], Acc) ->
  lists:reverse(Acc);
# match odd numbers
odd([Head|Tail], Acc) when Head rem 2 =:= 1 ->
  odd(Tail, [Head | Acc]);
# 
odd([Head|Tail], Acc) ->
  odd(Tail, Acc).
```

---

# Map and Filter built-ins

* The above is a bit tedious, so we use higher order functions to make our life easier
* Map: Takes a transformation function and a list
```erlang
times_two(List) ->
  lists:map(fun(N) -> 2*N end, List).
```
* Filter: Takes a predicate function and a list
```erlang
odd(List) ->
  lists:filter(fun(N) when N rem 2 =:= 1 ->
                 true;
                  (N) ->
                 false            
               end,
               List).
```

???

* Hey I've seen this in ruby/python etc!
  The concepts of functional programming don't need a full blown functional language to be useful.

---

# Fold and its siblings

* The swiss army knife 
* Takes a function that takes a value, and a list
* Returns a new list
* Sequentially takes the leftmost element of the list, applies the function to the value and an accumulator, and repeats with every successive element.

```erlang
add_if_odd(List) ->
  lists:foldl(fun(X, Sum) when X rem 2 =:= 1 ->
                X + Sum;
                 (X, Sum) ->
                Sum
              end,
              0,
              List).
```
* Foldl is left associative;
```
lists:foldl(F, 0, [1, 2, 3]) 

f(3, f(2, f(1, 0)))
```
* Sometimes order matters; foldr exists if you need the other ordering
* Use foldl preferentially (foldr isn't tail recursive)

???

* Sort of like ruby inject

---

# List comprehensions

These replace the list and map operations in practice
* More concise than the lists:map and lists:fold, and potentially more efficient and powerful
```erlang
[ X*X || X <- List, X < 4]
```
* Three parts
  * An operation; such as X*X
  * One (or more) 'taken from' operators; X <- List
  * optional guard

* The 'taken from' operation can be a match:
  ```{X, Y} <- List``` only takes elements that match {X, Y}
  If no match, skips that element	      
	       
* There can be more than one 'taken from'; in that case

* The filter operation can be any valid guard expression
	       
???

* The compiler has some clever optimizations to avoid unnecessary copies.

---

# List comprehensions in practice

* Map
```erlang
times_two(List) ->
  [X * 2 || X <- List].
```
* Filter: Takes a predicate function and a list
```erlang
odd(List) ->		 
  [X || X <- List, X rem 2 =:= 1 ].
```

  * This page is very helpful: http://erlang.org/doc/programming_examples/list_comprehensions.html

# Some thoughts on functional data structures.

* Consider basic insertion on a data structures
  NewData = insert(V, Data) 

* In imperative languages, you can mutate/overwrite the old Data

* In functional languages, you either have to
  * copy Data,
  * or do something clever

This cleverness has overhead.

* Hash is a good example; inserting up an element is constant time in the size of the Hash
* No equivalent in Erlang; the nearest equivalent structures take log(Size) time.

But it also has some huge benefits, such as the ability to easily save intermediate work and return to it.

???

* Don't get too caught up in the execution time difference; it rarely matters in practice.
