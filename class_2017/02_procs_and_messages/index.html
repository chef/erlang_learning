# Processes and Concurrency

Welcome back!

Today we'll cover the basic building blocks of concurrency in Erlang:

* processes: a way to isolate code and run it concurrently
* messages: this is how processes talk to each other.

---

# What is a Process?

* lightweight, isolated environment in which code runs concurrently
* messages are the only a process can be communicated with
* consider them as low-overhead OS threads:
  * low resource usage, very fast to create
	* most similar to the original Java 'green threads' implementation.
	* they have their own memory like a thread
	* less overhead than a thread, signficantly faster to start.
	* execution is scheduled by the Erlang VM.

_[1] except for binary data - that's in a future session._

---

# Spawning a Process

It's easy!  If you have code to run, you can run it as an Erlang process.

Example: simple_spawn

---

# What did we just do?

When we ran this, we saw something that looked much like this:

```
<0.36.0>
```

That's the process identifer (_PID_) of the spawned process.

This process won't do very much - it just returns "hello world" and
terminates. If we want it to learn about what it's doing (or has already done)
we'll need a way to talk to it.

---

# Sidebar: spawn

`spawn` and several related functions are at the core of erlang concurrency.

  * `spawn` is a built in function (_BIF_).
	* it allocates a new process and returns the process ID.
  * raises an error if it can't spawn the process.
	* more ways of starting a process in the next session

---

# Messages - the basics

Erlang provides messaging primitives:

  * `!` sends a message
	* `receive` receives a message
	* sending messages to remote processes is the same as sending to local.

Messages in Erlang are always copied[1] to be sent.

Example: receiver

[1] _Unless we're talking about large binaries. That's another one for next session._

---

# Messages - what can you send?

Anything - even functions.

Example: send_a_function

Cautionary note: because all messages are copied,
sending large non-binary messages can become expensive.

---

# Messages - the practical side

* erlang guarantees that all messages will be _delivered_
  if the recipient exists
	* if the recipient does not exist, you won't find out!
* it does not guarantee that all messages will be _received_.

* `receive` can be used in a case-style pattern match
   to pick and choose which messages you respond to.
* messages not received remain in the mailbox

Unlike a case statement, when a matching message is not found
the process will wait until it one arrivese instead of crashing with a bad match
or case statement error.

Example: selective_receive

---

# Messages: continuing to listen

Often you will want a process to receive more than just one messages.

This is most commonly done via a tail recursion call into the receive block.

Example: selective_receive_forever

# Messages: timeout

By adding a `after TimeInMS` clause to a `receive` block, you
will cause the process to timeout waiting for a matching message if none is received.

Example: receive_with_timeout

---

# Sidebar: process death

Some things to note:
	* any state held by the process is lost
	* any messages in its mailbox are lost
	* nothing else in the system is directly affected

More on this and ways to manage it in the next session.

---

# Messages - who sent that?

When your process receives a message, it will not know
where it came from unless the sender included that information.

* Erlang does not provide the PID of the sender
* In cases where the sender expects a reply, they will
  need to include the PID in their message.

Example: replying

---

# Sidebar: Objects and Processes

While objects are not thing that Erlang supports,
the behavior of processes is similar in a lot of ways to class instances:

* a process is an instance of running code with its own stack and heap.
* you interact with it - potentially changing its state - by sending messages.
