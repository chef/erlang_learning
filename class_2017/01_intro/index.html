# What is Erlang

## Erlang is:

* A functional programming language
* Designed for massive concurrency from day one
* Comes with OTP, which is a good pattern for resiliency

## Erlang is not:
* A particularly good systems programming language
* A way to get bare metal speed (but think twice before you say you
need that)
* Terribly similar to other common languages; learning curve is a thing

---
# What is this class about?

* Helping people new to Erlang get started
* Introducing the 'Chef Style' of Erlang
* Overview of the core Erlang components used by Chef 
* ... and the occasional deeper dive into interesting topics as we
  find them.
* It will be opinionated.

Guest sessions are welcome!

# This is not a substitute for the many good resources on erlang
* "Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good" is my favorite

  http://learnyousomeerlang.com or buy the book

* "Erlang Programming" by Francesco Cesarini and Simon Thompson, O'Reilly Press

  It's what I learned Erlang from, but it's not been updated in a while

* "Erlang and OTP in Action" by Eric Merritt, Martin Logan, and Richard Carlsson, Manning Press

   This covers some introductory material, but where it really shines is in it's coverage of the OTP runtime system.

---
# Why does Chef use Erlang?

* Functional/actor model makes it easy to reason about parallelism
* Erlang's OTP library makes it easy to build resilient systems
* Fail fast and recover vs lots of error handling
* Easily scales to tens of thousands of threads
* Per thread garbage collection makes handling web requests very
efficient
* Incredibly powerful built-in inspection tools for live systems. (Trace anything)

---
# What parts of Erlang do we not use
* Distributed communications
* Live systems update

---
# ERL

## All of our examples are being done in in the erlang REPL 'erl
    % erl
    >
## The erl shell is a powerful tool
### Beyond the normal uses of a repl it can also be used to connect to other running instances

## If an example begins with a '>' it's intended for the erlang shell.

## A later session will go into the shell in more detail

---
# Some Minor bits of syntax

## Everything in erlang is an expression.
## Expressions are separated by commas. (not semicolons like most every other language)

---
# Numeric  data types include integers and floats
    > 1.
    1
    > 1+1.0.
    2.0

## Integers are bignums
## Floats are IEEE 754 64 bit
---
# atoms
* Literal constant with a name
* Similar to ruby symbols
* Atoms are lowercase strings,
* Or any text quoted with a "'"
    > foo.
    foo
    > bar.
    bar.
    > 'a really odd symbol'

---
# Composite data types include
## Lists have a variable number of terms
    [ 1, 2, 3 ]

## Lists can be prepended to easily
	> [ 1 | [ 2, 3 ] ].
	[1,2,3]

---
# Tuples have a fixed number of terms.
    > {}.
    > { 1, 2, 3 }.

---
# Variables are Capitalized strings

## Variables can be bound or unbound; bound with the '=' operator
    > X = 1.
    > Y = 2.
    > X + Y.

## Once bound they are immutable
    > X = 1.
    > X = 2.

    Throws a bad match
---
# Named Functions

    add(A, B) ->
	  1, 
	  A + B.

* Name is an atom
* comma separated set of expressions
* The last expression is the return value
* Defined at the top level of a file

## We can bind a function to a variable
    Add = fun add/2

---
# Anonymous Functions
## Functions can be defined anonymously

## Here we bind a fun to the add variable
    Add = fun(A, B) -> A + B end.
## And here it is called at a later point
    Add(1, 2).

---
# Pattern matching is at the heart of erlang syntax

## the '=' is not like other languages;
## it's not assignment but a pattern matching operator
## The left hand side can be a mix of bound variables, constants and
unbound variables

---
# Pattern matching is at the heart of erlang syntax

## Simple matches look like assignment
    A = 1.
    B = foobar.
	
## But unbound variables become bound by a match
    > A = 1. % Now A is bound to 1
	1
    > A = 2.
	** exception error: no match of right hand side value 2

## More complex patterns can be matched, with a mix of bound and
    unbound variables.
    > A = 1.
    > {A, B, 3} = {1, 2, 3}.
    {1,2,3}
    > B.
    2

## Matches don't need any variables
   ok = DoSomething().

## when a match fails, we get a bad_match exception.

That's useful!

---
# Case statements
    
## Case statements are built from pattern matches
    case N of
      1 -> one;
      2 -> two;
      X -> unknown;
    end.

* Clauses are separated by ';'
* Terminated by 'end'
* Case statements do not need to be exhaustive
* First match succeeds
* Free variables on the left hand side of the '->' will be bound on
the right hand side

---
# Functions can also be match statements
    fact(1) ->
      1;
    fact(X) -> 
      X * fact(X-1).
     

---
# No looping in erlang

## Recursion (see the factorial example above)
   Variables in a function aren't mutable; how do we update state?
   Call ourselves with the new state

    loop(0, Acc) ->
      ok;
    loop(N, Acc) ->
      loop(N-1, Acc+1).
  
## Erlang is fully tail recursive
    If the last expression in a function is a function call,     

## More on that when we do the functional programming and erlang
